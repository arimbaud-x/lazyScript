# superLazyScript

**superLazyScript** is a fork of [lazyScript](https://github.com/laytya/LazyScript), an in-game attack scripting language for Vanilla clients. It is aimed at users who would like to write more complex in-game macros, but who do not want to have to deal with the full blown API or do not want to have to write a separate add-on for every macro over 250 characters. https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/LazyScript
**superLazyScript** incorporates [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW), [Quiver](https://github.com/SabineWren/Quiver) (for hunters) and [SP_SwingTimer](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/SP_SwingTimer) to make existing features better, and add new features too. superLazyScript is developed for ~~TurtleWoW~~ OctoWoW.

- New look & feel
- Modern fonts
- New & improved interrupt mask logic.
  >*Previously, the addon had no way to know the duration of a spellcast, so would have to guess and end up queuing up a kick well after a spell had already been cast. This has been fixed.*
- Fixes and improvements to the `active=echo` command
  >*This feature went undocumented and impractical. Now it's actually big and readable. It's intent is to let you know which script is currently active.*
- Added a new 'Extras' tab to the help menu, noting down undocumented features.


### new masks

`-ifAutoShotSafe` requires [Quiver](https://github.com/SabineWren/Quiver) and is a safe way to cast hunter spells without ever clipping the reload timer.

i think this is some chinese paywalled fork and it has like more nampower and superwow integration but i didnt opt to replace the texture based spell identification with a spellid based one because cba anyway thought it was interesting also theres some google code original repo from 20 years ago drifting around somewhere but killed by google ofc hard to find it you find it tell me nice to add here lowk
